# battery_management_system_design

Using PySpice to simulate circuit design based on the All About Circuits "Create an Arduino Controlled Battery Charger" project created by Jason Poel Smith (https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/create-an-arduino-controlled-battery-charger/).


battery_charger_design.py will be the main file. Different circuit components will be stored in the circuits_components.py file.
